# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository where we showcase several studies and projects completed in group of 3 as part of our six-month coursework in Python-focused machine learning. Below, you'll find detailed information about the techniques and algorithms we explored, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), linear regression, ensemble learning, and more.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured into several directories, each corresponding to one of the practical exercises (TPs) and our final project. Each directory contains its own README.md providing specifics about the objectives, methods used, and conclusions drawn.

### Featured Projects

- **Linear Regression Model to Predict House Prices**  
   - **Objective:** Explore how a linear regression model can be used to predict real estate prices effectively.
   - **Techniques Used:** Linear regression analysis, data preprocessing, and model validation.

- **TP 5 - Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Ensemble Learning**  
   - **Objective:** Understand and implement decision trees and random forests to enhance prediction models through ensemble techniques.
   - **Centered On:** Improving model accuracy by integrating multiple learning models.

- **Comparative Study of Ensemble Learning for Predicting COVID-19**  
   - **Dataset:** COVID-19 dataset from TP3, featuring anonymized patient data from the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
   - **Objective:** Predict COVID-19 infection status from clinical data using ensemble learning methods.
   - **Data Standardization:** All data has been anonymized and standardized to have zero mean and unit variance.

- **Unsupervised Learning: Dimensionality Reduction**  
   - **Objective:** Explore techniques to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while retaining its informational value.

- **Anomaly Detection: Bank Fraud Case Study**  
   - **Objective:** Implement anomaly detection to identify fraudulent transactions in banking.

- **Predicting Loan Defaulters**  
   - **Objective:** Develop models to predict potential loan defaulters based on historical financial behavior.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Objective:** Perform initial checks and explorations of datasets to understand patterns, outliers, and underlying structures.

## Technologies Used

Throughout these projects, we utilized Python and several of its libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib to conduct data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Privacy

We emphasize that all data used in these projects have been anonymized and processed in compliance with international best practices concerning data privacy and security.
